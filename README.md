#### Using PHPs built-in server

_clone this git repo and put it where you like it and `cd` into it_

```sh
php -S localhost:port
```

#### Using Apache/XAMPP

_have `PHP` and `PDO` with SQLite support installed_

```sh
git clone https://github.com/actuallyaridan/chirp
mv chirp /var/www/
# Or other place your Apache or XAMPP install uses for hosting coontent

**BTW that folder should be empty - if it's something like `/htdocs/chirp` it will 99% break**

#### Database

This project is currently using SQLite. Chrips database is not included in GitHub, as it contains sensntive information that will not be shared publicly. There are however refereces in the PHP files, so you can create an empty replica if you'd like to.
